# Graduate Exercise

## Setup

Requirements:
- git (https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git)
- node/npm (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- github account (https://github.com)

You should clone this repository and run `npm install` from the correct directory within your terminal. Once all of the files are installed, you should be able to run `npm run dev` - you should see the following:

`ðŸš„ Server running @ http://localhost:3000`

If you open your browser and point it to that URL, you should see a blank HMTL.

## Tasks

Now that youâ€™re setup, you will need to complete a few tasks - the core functionality of the application is to display information around _todo_ tasks. It is required to complete the following tasks using React.js.

Whilst you have been provided with a blank HTML page which loads a CSS and Javascript file, you are able to change all parts of the existing code, as long as we complete the following tasks:

- Load and display the _todo_ items `title` from http://localhost:3000/api/todos ordering them on their ID in descending order
- Display the total number of _todo_ items
- Display the completed number of _todo_ items
- Add styling

## Submission

Once you have completed the task, we ask that you create a github repository and send it over to us for review.
